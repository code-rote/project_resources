## Notes from Wunderlist
  > User stories are levels... First read then start git flow
    1. read req
    2. write pseudo code in the console.
    3. Then it comments out after
    4. Allow you to go function by function getting points along the way

  > Single page app, codeschool meets paired programming
  > Make it a platform to build little team adventures in app land
  > Gamified by giving points per feature built as part of team
  > 1/2 screen code 2/2 notes and your slide blend typing area
  > number of users (2+) active for multi-player. (1) for single-player w/rankings.

  -Practicing git

  >* Could load two sets and one is there highlighted but opaque when the key press the full one comes into view
  >* Typewriter/single pane mode. Touch type copying. Side by side guitar hero mode. You build it reference to side lighting up as go along. Ghost letters on freeform canvas
  >* Only match on key press enter and either proceed or mark string red from error... So you have to visually correct it.
  >* **Analytics and self tracking**
    1. Count of completed functions per minute
    2. Cumulative time spent typing divided by avg wpm
    3. etc.

### Multiplayer Features
    IDEA: crash course in gitflow workflow through habdson exercises for small agile teams
  >* Live socket io view into your buddies environment
  >* Live debugging (google docs real-time edit)
  >* ALL ACTIVITIES BASED AROUND GROUPS OF 3-5 peeps in under 8 hr
  >* Remote support via hangout API
  >* Love commit message stream along side alerts on new commits

  >* Little tiny slider bar for difficulty fades code commits important pieces (think rock smith)
    1. Complete gamification!
    2. Almost scrolling as you type each function, points rank up according to speed and accuracy
    3. Combine learning with rote learning and repetition
    4. Build simple blog app
    5. Add models as they make sense... mainly a CRM as a logical next 'group' project for business devs.
    6. Have groups change and modify DB in more advanced lessons.






### Nice-to-have
  * Documentation is part of the presentation
  * Can access lessons on phone to type along to script
  * Overlay it with inverse snippet to allow matching for keywords and variable names but leave flexibility of namespace
  * Errors subtract points and cause errors in particular files that your teammate may be in or have to edit. Causes additional time added to your time and teams avg time and
  * Store important keys for them to download a full file with install instructions on how to install on your local machine and video to do it... Better yet send via email then script during grunt
  * App Icons, 
  * Different Modes/Level of difficulty: Modes - student, ninjas, arcade, mafia(games VIC used to play)
  * bottom of page like kindle "5 mins left in chapter"

SuperUser: 
  > Edit comments and change variable names is simple edit. Advanced below is freeform and based on test suite

  > Allow people to go into edit mode change comments or text as long as it passes all tests they can save their custom level And do timetrials
   * With leader board
   * Arcade game of material design
   




### Tools/Tech needed
- Ruby parser? 
- JS parser
- Front end data entry/keyboard tracker
- Cloud-based IDE (Orion eclipse)
- Sublime shortcuts as keyentry, esp snippets, cmd+tab
- Options: TDD mode adds the test layer in (off by default for student beginner
