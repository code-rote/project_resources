# WDI Project 2: code-rote

## Product
### Inspiration and Product Ideation for code-rote
  >* Concept of 10,000 hours for mastery (lead me to think of repetition, and rote learning)
  >* Homework assignment of repetition in sequence of a simple "full app" made a huge difference in my understanding of the material and helped build my confidence in a relatively short time (~8 hrs)

### Tag-line
  >* Coders learn faster by rote learning
  >* Helping coders learn faster by Gamifying Rote learning
  >* code-rote is NOT just a physical exercise. At it's core it promises both mental exercise and rote practice.



# Elevator Pitch
  >* The goal is to build a 'read-a-long' or 'type-a-long' adventure game that makes leveling-up your developer skills fun instead of a chore. 
  >* To be clear, we are initially targeting people with 6 mo to 1 yr of coding experience. Our differentiator in the marketplace is that we integrate high-quality notes into our gaming process. Which allows a player to gain the benefits of ROTE learning for both the physical and mental processes.


# Features (non-technical)
  >* Time tracking and a way to track progress over time
  >* A way to easily "see" my improvement (not necessarily just a visual element)
  >* Notes (high-quality, tested 'read-a-long' lessons)
  >* Ability to capture Code input from a users device
  >* Relevant 'Supplemental Resources' to aide in learning (It's hard to know where to start with SO many blogs and "best ways" to do things.)
  >* Ability to "save" the work I've "completed" while on the 'type-a-long' adventure. (will help to ensure the user doesnt feel they are wasting their time.)
  >* Ability to challenge my friends (competitively and/or collaboratively)
  >* Ability to 

# Features (non-technical)
  >* character matching based on keyboard input
  >* time tracking metrics (timers, calculated fields, user_scores, etc.)
  >* Syntax highlighting (real-time)


# User Experience Analysis
  Persona: Wants to practice `sequential steps` and `read along` with the notes.


# Assumptions
  > __Riskiest Assumption__: There are enough 'standardized' processes and patterns in code to have a robust series of "levels" to keep the users coming back.

  > People will accept that there is value to typing along, instead of free-form problem solving. 
  <small></small>(Note: we are NOT advocating that problem solving is less important than muscle memory and procedural recollection. However, the marketplace is filled with "teach yourself to code" platforms. Yet, in my research the only peer competitor is Typing.io who have a different market segment and focus.)


# Key Take-Aways
  >* Do not include a 'framework' of any size unless you read AT LEAST the first section of documentation, and really, AT LEAST the first page... __README's aren't just a "convention"__. Respect the effort that was put into the library and save yourself HOURS of debugging down the road. _(SEE: Bootstrap's container vs container-fluid for a good example.)_
  >* __Gold-plating is the devil__, especially when you dont even have silver plates yet. Meaning, finish the core before you move on to anything more.
  >* Libraries can rewrite what you do (i.e. break something that you "fixed", or "break" something new). 


# Hanging Chads
1. Need to find the motivation to keep doing a certain thing (i.e. playing my game)
2. Identify the core problem of the User and their Goal

# Wishlist technical features
combo chaining => powerups
only show the time @ end (not during a snippet)
open modal on start or fade the non critical portion out of view
mario kart AI that races along with you as you type (or along scrolling bar)
guitarcade-like "random" snippet timed, as long as you want but you cannot stop... and it gets faster... like the line itself will disappear.


# Competitive Analysis
> WPM games
  * positives
   - timed
   - practice muscle memory
  * negatives
   - not sequenced
   - mostly a physical exercise (not mental)

  > typing.io
  > Mavis Beacon Typing Training

  > Music games
   Rocksmith Gamification of another skill gained through rote practice (guitar and music has MANY scales)(Guitar Hero)
   sequenced (in the sense that the previous sequence is related to the next sequence.) It's not very fun to 'practice' scales. But turn it into a game (ala Rocksmiths Guitarcade and you have a winner...)
